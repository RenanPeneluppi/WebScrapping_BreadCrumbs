In this Jupyter Notebook I go thru the process of web scrapping the full breadcrumbs path
from HomeDepot website.

Packages used: Requests and BeautifullSoup

This was part of a challenge from a job application. Initially, I was asked to get the breadcrumbs and product features for any sub-category.
However, after the interview, I kept working on it to be able to scrape the entire website. 

A different use I can see for the same code is to get a price list for every product listed in any category while maintaining a Category>SubCategory>Sub SubCategory> product name / URL > Product info path
